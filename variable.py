#python is an object oriented language,it is no variable type ,so if you define a variable
# you can use it directorily

myint = 7
# this will auto assign 7 to the variable myint and declare the myint as an int type
# as well as follow will be float

myfloat = 7.0

myString = "this is my string"

# as well ,you can declare two variable and assign them values useing ","
# as follows

my_int_one,my_int_two = 1,2

# the result

print myint

print myfloat

print myString

print my_int_two

print my_int_one
